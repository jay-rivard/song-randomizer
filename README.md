# song-randomizer

Java GUI used to randomize a key, tempo, chord progression, and melody.

Only the 12 major and minor scales are included in the pool of scales. 
Only base triad chords are included in the pool of chords - no 7th, 9th chords.

Currently (as of v1.0) the custom fonts included do not display in the executable JAR file release.
    
Below is a screenshot demonstrating the running GUI with custom fonts :
